PLACEHOLDER FOR ASSETS

This directory should contain the following assets:

1. splash.png - The app's splash screen and logo image
   - Recommended size: 1024x1024 pixels
   - Used in SplashScreen.js and other components

2. Other images for the app (optional)
   - Hotel images
   - Icon images
   - Background images

Note: The app currently uses remote URLs for images, but you can replace them with local assets by:
1. Adding the images to this directory
2. Updating the image references in the code to use require statements
   Example: source={require('../../assets/splash.png')}
